# Single categories tree
This project presents a single tree of categories with CRUD abilities.

## Some comments:
- Multiple trees support isnwt available in this version due to the time frame, but I took it into consideration while designing the components.

- Towards the end of this task development, I meant to add support for infinite lists (or very large lists) using react-virtualized library but it worked partially (I had issues displaying items and CRUD operations not working as expected).
I took a desicion to dop it and submit a working app.
I left the partiall code in comments so you can see my initial plan.
